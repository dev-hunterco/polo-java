# HunterCo Polo Messenger

Polo is a lightweight framework designed to enable exchange of asynchronous messages between applications (usually in a microservice environment).

Message transport is based on AWS SQS (and SNS for events, in the future).

## Anatomy of messages

Polo defines two (very straightforward) types of messages:

* Request: When one application wants to call a service to a second app.
* Response: When the second application sends the first a response 

### Request Message

Here's a sample of a request message:

```
{ 
    id: <message_id>,
    conversation: <conversation_id>,
    type: 'request',
    sentBy: { 
        application: <app id>,
        instance: <app instance>,
        callback: <app queue url> 
    },
    service: <service name>,
    body: <service parameters>,
    payload: <message payload>,
    timestamp: <message timestamp>
}
```

Where:
* message_id: Message's Unique global identifier (created automatically)
* conversation_id: Any identifier that can give context to a set a messages exchanged among many applications and could be used to track all the messages exchanged for a unique event, for exemple. When a application responds a request, it will keep the same conversation id.
* app id: The application's identifier
* app instance: Application's instance identifier (when the app has multiple agents running)
* app queue url: SQS queue url to where responses must be sent.
* service name: the name of the service that source application wants to invoke on target service.
* service parameters: input data for the service.
* message payload: any information relevant for the *source* application (and irrelevant to the target) that must be attached to the response.
* timestamp: when the message was created.

### Response Message

Here's a sample of a response message:

```
{ 
    id: <message_id>,
    conversation: <same as the request>,
    type: 'response',
    sentBy: { 
        application: <app id>,
        instance: <app instance>,
        callback: <app queue url> 
    },
    service: <service name>,
    body: <service parameters>,
    success: <true|false>,
    payload: <message payload>,
    timestamp: <message timestamp>,
    originalMessage: <the content of the request message>
}
```

As you can see, the structure of an answer is quite the same of a request, with some small differences:
* success: True of false if the message has being properly processed or not. It's initially used by the framework to identify invalid messages (with details in the body)
* originalMessage: The request message.

Notice that both conversation and payload will keep the same information found in the request.

# Configuring the API

# Exposing a service

The code bellow shows how an application exposes a service:

```
PoloMessaging poloAPI = new PoloMessaging(config);
poloAPI.initializeSQS();

poloAPI.onRequest ("greetings", new RequestHandlerInterface() {
	public void processRequest(RequestMessage message) throws PoloMessagingException {
	    Map<String, Object> response = new HashMap<>();
	    response.put("answer", "Nice to meet you!");
        message.reply(response);
	}
});

```

# Consuming a service

The code bellow shows how an application consumes a service:

```
PoloMessaging poloAPI = new PoloMessaging(config);
poloAPI.initializeSQS();

// Get ready for responses from the target service
poloAPI.onResponse("greetings", new ResponseHandlerInterface() {
    	public void processResponse(ResponseMessage message) throws PoloMessagingException {
		message.done();
    	}        	
});
   
// Send a request
String message = "Hello there... I'm the Requester";
poloAPI.sendRequest("otherApp", "greetings", message);

```

# Processing messages arrived

Polo won't read the queue automatically and the applications (both consumer and producer) must invoke the readMessages methods, as in the example:

```
int numOfMessages = poloAPI.readMessages();
System.out.println(numOfMessages + " messages read !");    
```

# Forwarding messages

Messages can be forwarded to another application to be consumed. It's mostly used when you have, for example, a broker or orchestrator that will decide where to send the message to.

Here's an example of how to forward a message:

```
poloAPI.onResponse("greetings", new ResponseHandlerInterface() {
    	public void processResponse(ResponseMessage message) throws PoloMessagingException {
		message.forward("anotherApp");
    	}        	
});
```

When a message is forwarded it keeps track of the original sender using the SentBy field, although a new "forwardedBy" property is added to the message to enable tracking.

# MVN Dependencies

To be able to use Polo in your project you should just add the dependency, as the following:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>br.com.hunterco</groupId>
	<artifactId>polo</artifactId>
	<version>${polo.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

# Who is Polo

Polo is the Tupi-Guarani god of the winds, messenger of Tup√£.

# Other implementations

Polo is also available to NodeJS - http://github.com/dev-hunterco/polo-nodejs
